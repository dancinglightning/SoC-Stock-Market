Currently, we've covered simple perceptrons - both single-layer and multi-layer; using the Hebb's algorithm; on which we've tested a sample dataset of 30 items; for binary classification. The accuracy is high, and the weights required will appear on executing the given code.

We've also added a separate .py file spelled wrongly - this file comprises of my own extra work comprising making a 3-layer neural network which acts as a classifier using Logistic Regression; and implements Gradient Descent for optimization.

We've also completed Time Dependant Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptron Network.

When it comes to the Statistics part of it, we've also done the testing and implementation of various standard models, including Stock Forecasting, Time Series, Garch, arch and the arima model.

We also made a separate model to run a hybrid Garch-LSTM model.
