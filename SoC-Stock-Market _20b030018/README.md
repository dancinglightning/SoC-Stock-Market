Currently, we've covered simple perceptrons - both single-layer and multi-layer; using the Hebb's algorithm; on which we've tested a sample dataset of 30 items; for binary classification. The accuracy is high, and the weights required will appear on executing the given code.

I've also added a separate .py file spelled wrongly - this file comprises of my own extra work comprising making a 3-layer neural network which acts as a classifier using Logistic Regression; and implements Gradient Descent for optimization.

We've also completed Time Dependant Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptron Network. I'm currently doing LSTMs. Will add that in a few days.
